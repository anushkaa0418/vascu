{"0": ["You do not have any cardiovascular problems at the moment but regular physical activity is crucial for cardiovascular health. Aim for a mix of aerobic, strength, and flexibility exercises.\nAs for food, adopt healthy eating habits to avoid any problems in the future"], "1": ["Exercise Plans:\n\nAerobic Exercise\nFrequency: 3-5 days a week, gradually increasing to 5 days if well-tolerated.\nDuration: Start with shorter sessions (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase to 30-60 minutes.\nIntensity: Begin with light to moderate intensity (40-60% of maximum heart rate) and only increase to moderate (60-70%) after assessing tolerance. Use the \"talk test\" to ensure you're not overexerting; you should be able to talk but not sing during exercise.\nActivities: Choose low-impact activities like walking, cycling, or swimming. Avoid high-impact or strenuous activities initially.\n\nStrength Training\nFrequency: 2 days a week to start, potentially increasing to 3 days if well-tolerated.\nDuration: 15-20 minutes per session.\nIntensity: Use light to moderate weights (40-60% of one-rep max). Focus on higher repetitions (12-15 reps) rather than heavier weights.\nActivities: Prioritize exercises that use resistance bands or bodyweight to reduce the risk of injury. Avoid straining or holding breath (Valsalva maneuver).\n\nFlexibility and Balance Exercises\nFrequency: 2-3 days a week.\nDuration: 10-15 minutes per session.\nActivities: Emphasize gentle stretching, yoga, or tai chi. These activities can improve flexibility and balance, reducing the risk of falls.\n\nSafety Tips\nWarm-Up and Cool-Down: Ensure a proper warm-up and cool-down period of at least 5-10 minutes to gradually increase and decrease heart rate.\n\nMonitor Symptoms: Pay close attention to any warning signs like chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or palpitations. Stop exercising immediately if any of these symptoms occur and seek medical advice.\n\nHydration: Stay well-hydrated, especially if taking medications that affect fluid balance.\n\nSupervision: Initially, consider exercising under the supervision of a cardiac rehabilitation specialist or a fitness professional experienced in working with cardiovascular patients.\n\nAdditional Recommendations\nRegular Check-Ups: Have regular follow-ups with your healthcare provider to monitor your condition and adjust the exercise program as needed.\n\nPersonalized Plan: Your healthcare provider can help tailor the exercise program to your specific needs and limitations, ensuring a safe and effective approach to improving cardiovascular health.", "Recommended Food Items:\n1.
